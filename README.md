# Blog

ideas:

requirements:
- home page with blog v-cards going in reverse order from creation date
- when click on v-card, opens full blog post in separate page
- admin account that can go to the website and add posts


backend design:
- controllers:
    - tokenController
    - blogController
- services:
    - blogService
    - 

- tests:
    - 


later additions:
- views (keep it simple for now)
- ability to add pictures or text specifications (italics, underline, etc.) within adding post editor?
